Sleet / freezing rain / slushy snow. Pick your poison. We've got all three.

Elsewhere, it's shaping up to be the first really nasty spring-style weather day.

In programming news, I've fixed the Kansas/Arkansas bug for about the thousandth time. See, I keep rewriting code and/or changing languages, and every time I write a state parser, I forget that Kansas will match Arkansas *100% of the time* unless you change the behaviour. For me, I've fixed it by having it look for " &lt;state&gt;" (so a space before the state name). And on the plus side, I wrote tests for both of the places where it was breaking, so if I rebreak it later, I'll know sooner.

And the reports page on [wickedwx.com](http://wickedwx.com) is broken again. It says there are no reports today. Well, that's cause the script that updates it has been breaking. I swear, the storm reports code must be the single most buggy thing I've ever written. I keep fixing it; it keeps breaking.

Off for more troubleshooting. I live for this, right.
