At 180bpm, it's definitely way faster than I generally write.

We'll call it "tempo creep". It started out at 140bpm, and got increased automatically to 160bpm when I imported some drums. I didn't notice it until later, and then found that 140bpm seemed to slow. And for whatever reason, I decided to go for 180bpm and then I liked that.

Yeah.

Not that I can actually play at 180bpm or anything.
