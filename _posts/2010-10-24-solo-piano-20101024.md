Originally, http://theweather.at was supposed to be about ambient *sounds*. You'd go there and you'd get some background ambience complementary to what your current weather conditions were.

But I'm thinking it's a good excuse to really dig into learning how to make ambient music.

I've done some ambient pieces here and there, but they always feel like they're largely centered around *someone else's* evolving patch. So I feel like the piece wasn't really mine because its foundation wasn't mine.

So it's yet another thing on my list: learn how to make ambient music and generative music from scratch.

And of course, one of the problems with generative music and *me* is that I'm very much attached to the idea of being able to go back and perfect something, even if there's a good chance that I actually won't. I just need that reassurance.

So I need something that will be both random yet after-the-fact tweakable. Does it even exist?

Something tells me no.
