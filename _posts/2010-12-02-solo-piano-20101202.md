### Last month:

* daily habit: drinking ~32 ounces of water every morning.
* compliance: probably 95%.
* result: have dropped the habit because there was no benefit great enough to offset the unpleasant of my drinking my freaking freezing **room temperature** water every morning.

### This month:
* daily habit: practicing drums on Rock Band every morning, both as a way to start up with the drums again and to see if I can, um, "remove" those 6 pounds I gained during November with drumming as my only exercise.
* compliance: 2 for 2 so far.
* result: oy! My forearm!
