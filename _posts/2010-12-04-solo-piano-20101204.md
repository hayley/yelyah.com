Yowsa. This piece has 16 lanes. And if you're not familiar with Record, that basically means I had 15 false starts before I finally got this one.

I chalk it up to 2 main problems:

1. I wasn't real familiar with the left hand pattern I was *originally* trying to play.
2. My fingernails are too long.

So I scrapped my original idea after 15 tries and then went with something more familiar.

But my fingernails were still a problem.

I think it's because it makes it difficult to get a solid "landing" and furthermore, your fingers are way more likely to slip because the nails themselves are slick on the keys.

At least the fingernail problem is an easy fix.
