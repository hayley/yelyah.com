Sometimes I listen to music right before a songwriting session. Sometimes for ideas, sometimes just because I need that extra boost from hearing something I like.

The song that directly preceded tonight's improv? [Melanie C's "Goin' Down"](http://rd.io/x/QJRCK2TQTw) courtesy of last.fm's "play my library" radio station.

I was goofing around trying to match chords to the song. And probably I didn't even come close. But I did come up with something I liked enough to use as a starting point for the improv.

Mission accomplished.
