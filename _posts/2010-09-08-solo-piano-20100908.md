My first day without Uncharted, and how about that, I actually used my free time for something other than headshots.

I finally finished watching/coding along to the node.js screencast that I bought weeks ago. So javascript is starting to feel slightly more familiar.

I might just skip learning coffeescript for now and focus on learning real JS. And then make a judgment call later as to whether coffeescript is worth the extra compile step.

I just wish there were as simple (and as free) of a web host as [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/). App Engine gives you that extra shot in the arm to say "hey, why not?" when you know that the web page would have to get pretty popular before you'd end up paying for it. That and deploying on App Engine is way straightforward.

I've been spoiled!
