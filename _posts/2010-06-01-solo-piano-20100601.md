Pro tip: If you have a plumber doing work on something in a closet, make sure you can shut the door before they leave, and not that that something new got installed that makes shutting the door a difficult thing.

Also, be sure to ask the question "will my water be off for the duration?" because they either aren't thinking of the impact and/or aren't volunteering this information.

Finally, make sure that you can actually turn on all faucets and not that something got shut so tight that you have to break out your own tools to actually do something like say, wash your hands.

That is all.
