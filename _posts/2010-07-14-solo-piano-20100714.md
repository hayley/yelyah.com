Fun things continue with Uncharted 2. Apparently the disc is bad (or so I'm guessing). There's a coop level that I can apparently no longer play now, because um, the floor is missing.

I can watch other players run over the missing floor just fine. But if I try to venture onto it, the game thinks that I'm about to drop off a cliff.

I have to wonder what it looks like to the other players. Do they see me fall through the floor to my death?

It's like quantum teleportation at its worst!
