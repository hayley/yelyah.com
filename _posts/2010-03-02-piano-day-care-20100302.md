"piano day care" - piano/strings/drum/bass, short

---

I feel kinda upset. My schedule the past 2 days has been getting jacked up by other things, so I seem to end up in the studio in the midst of an energy dip (granted, if I were eating/sleeping better, I shouldn't be having energy dips at all). And it's already draining enough to write a song in the first place. But to try to write when sleepy... ugh.
