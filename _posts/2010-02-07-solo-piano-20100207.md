Did I mention I'm taping my songwriting sessions?

So I now have about 30 minutes of footage of me totally screwing around at the beginning of this session. Listening to Spotify. Playing melodies by ear and such.

And then I finally decided to buckle down, and the chord progression that starts the song is what came to me.

I have a general direction for the lyrics, but very few of the actual lines finished.

Post FAWM, right? That's what I keep saying.
