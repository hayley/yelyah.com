Today's the last day of August.

I decided approximately one month ago to start using TaskPaper for tracking my todos. And that every month I'd start the list over in a new file, to prevent burnout (given that sometimes I think I'm changing my todo list software so often just to get a fresh start).

So tomorrow I'll get to start over. Realizing that I didn't complete *a single freaking August project*.

Oh sure, I did a lot in the meantime, but every semi-big project I hoped to complete in August...

I procrastinate.
