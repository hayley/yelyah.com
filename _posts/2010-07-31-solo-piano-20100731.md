Totally unrelated to tonight's piece, I forgot to mention how freaky it was to me that I ended up writing something in 3/4 time last night.

I seldom ever touch non 4/4 time signatures. It's probably thanks to the patch that ended up kicking off the piece. 3/4 time seemed to be strongly implied. Which was a problem since I had no idea how to write a proper rhythm in 3/4. But hey, it's a learning experience.

And now you know, if a piano piece of mine has a measure or two in a non 4/4 time signature, it was probably an accident.
