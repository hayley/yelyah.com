Played a whole bunch of Farmville RL today.

My prize: a RL sunburn, lots of bits of broken glass, and lots of nails and rocks that came with the original house.

"Where should I put these unused nails? Should I throw them away?"

"Nah. Just throw them in the flower bed over there. I'm sure no one will actually want to use it."
