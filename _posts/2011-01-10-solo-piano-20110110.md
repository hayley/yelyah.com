Murphy's law of tardiness and computing:

> When running late, that's when your computer will decide to act up.

Case in point today, with its panic inducing spinning beachballs of death. And the fact that my audio device's sound went "missing" again - something cured by a reboot.

Why yes, a reboot I don't have time for today, thank you very much.
