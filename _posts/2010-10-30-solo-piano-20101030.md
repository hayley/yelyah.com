Fact: I never was both a fiction writer and a songwriter at the same time. In the past, I've either been passionate about writing or I've been passionate about songwriting. But never both at the same time. And of course, there's been plenty of times that I've been passionate about neither.

2 years ago, I attempted to do both National Novel Writing Month and my personal song-a-week. I succeeded at neither.

2 years later, something tells me it's time to take another stab at it.

Whether I actually will, though...
