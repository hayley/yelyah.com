I had to start this one a few times to get it going.

I came up with an intro I liked on the first try, but totally screwed it up with a chord change that was wayyyy out of the key. And generally, any time I screw up that close to the beginning of a piece, I just restart.

And in a sense, there's where problems generally happen. I try to recreate that intro that I really liked, but now I'm trying to play it from memory instead of by... um, feel, so I mess it up in some way, and have to do several tries before I finally get it right.

And I still wasn't happy with the chord I ended up hitting, which I'm pretty sure was Adim. I'm not sure I've ever intentionally written a diminished chord into anything.

And I sure didn't tonight either.
