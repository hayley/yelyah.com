Amazing how just 20 seconds in a downpour can leave you soaked for hours.

Which is precisely why I chose to unstrap my Vibrams and hide them under my shirt, for whenever they get soaked, they stay wet for *days*.

So if you saw someone today sprinting through the rain totally barefoot, yeah, that was me.
