I have an evil plan. Well, not really.

I'm attempting to learn [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), because I'm learning that real Javascript just... frightens me on some level. For all the enthusiasm I've had to learn [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), I just can't get over the fact that it's written in JS.

There's just something so tedious and alien looking about it to me. Whereas, I look at coffeescript and it makes much more sense to me. And without all that obnoxious punctuation.

So the semi evil plan is to find lots and lots of JS code and rewrite it in coffeescript, which theoretically accomplishes 3 things:

1. get real familiar with coffeescript syntax
1. get familiar with programming patterns in JS by having rewritten lots and lots of code
1. make JS less scary because I'll have to read a whole bunch of it in order to translate it, won't I?

I'd rather be writing Python, but for what I want to build next, I think learning JS will be inevitable, so I might as well get it over with. Ya know, by writing something that's not really Javascript.
