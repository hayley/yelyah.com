My weather radio went off twice today.

The first time, the storm had already passed us (after shorting the power to my PS3 and ruining an awesome online match in Uncharted 2).

The second time, it was far north in the county and we didn't even get wet.

Granted, I can't complain much. S.A.M.E. is lovely and it's better than getting woken up at 4 am by a flash flood warning that's 100+ miles away.
