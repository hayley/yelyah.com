I beat Uncharted 2 on hard today.

The crazy thing is that I think I played through it much quicker than my previous play through on Very Easy (one game called me a "content tourist") in October and then on Normal like a month ago.

I don't think I'm much better of a player now than I was then; I just got way more cautious so there were a lot fewer deaths. I must say that it felt like I spent a good portion of the game in black and white (if you've played it, you'll know what I mean).

Plus, I'm not ashamed to admit that I abused the heck out of a glitch to beat the final boss.

I can recommend this [youtube video of the easy way to beat Lazarevic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyaBWNc5gZ4) which shows the exact method I used. It's amazing. You can stand there for ages and Lazarevic will never shoot you, he won't throw you, and he'll never drop a grenade. You just have to keep mashing the square button at the appropriate times as he tries to beat you silly (which is never enough to kill you) and then shoot the sap when it grows back.

4 minutes to kill him beats my previous record which I'm guessing was in the range of 30 minutes and involved my running around like an idiot, basically praying that Lazarevic would blow himself up.

Now that I know the glitch awaits me, I might even attempt Crushing.

Before the library wants the game back.
