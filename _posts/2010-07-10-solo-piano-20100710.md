Ran into a fun problem leading me to immediately think the worst, that something was corrupted with my software somewhere.

I was hearing two *wrong* things:

1. I was getting octave "doubling": like striking C4 would sometimes produce C5.
1. I was getting increased (ambient) white noise.

Long story short, I think it was the fact that my piano had two (internal) voices turned on and apparently this was somehow getting translated into a double-strike on the piano.

But what's odd is that I can't tell from the piano roll that anything's wrong. I see no double notes, yet playing the bad parts back would produce identical results.

Some days I really hate computers.
