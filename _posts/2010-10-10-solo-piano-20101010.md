This one was preceded by total chaos. We'll call it a warmup.

Which must explain why I was playing too fast for my hands and brain to make a proper connection.

And Rails Rumble is next weekend. I thought I'd be much further along by now.

So these next few days can be all about cramming a ton of knowledge into my brain.

And if my school years taught me anything, that means I'll have forgotten it all by the following weekend.
