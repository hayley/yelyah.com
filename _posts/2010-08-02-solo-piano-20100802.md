For reasons I'll get to, I was reminded of the artist who did some poll on twitter and said something along the lines of "Be honest. How many of you bought my album and how many torrented it?"

Apparently there was even some sort of collaborative thing going where, for those fans who couldn't afford to buy it, other generous fans would step forward and purchase copies for them.

And why it's relevant to today is this. That artist totally left out the segment of people who get the music another way (no, not newsgroups): the online streaming services.

I ended up with a free trial to one of the streaming services and I finally got to listen to one of the albums I've been waiting to hear for months. And before that, I had been waiting on it for a decade to be released at all.

Sadly, it was mostly a meh experience. Such is life.
