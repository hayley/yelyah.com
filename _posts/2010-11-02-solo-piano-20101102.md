I met my word quota yesterday. My 1,667/day for nanowrimo.

It was 90% stream of consciousness ramblings. I'm still waiting for a story to start.

I once was a writer. I once daydreamed a lot about story ideas.

Now it just doesn't call to me.

But I really want to give nano a shot this year. And actually do the 50,000.

Dayum. I just looked it up and my first nano was in 2004. I've skipped at least one of those years, maybe two. I've never won.

That's gonna change this year. Verdammt!
