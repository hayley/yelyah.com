My first serious/non-serious effort on the [Everyday Looper iPhone app](http://www.mancingdolecules.com/everyday-looper/).

Stats:

* 100% recorded through the iPhone
* probably 95% iPhone headset mic, 5% internal mic
* 98% my voice, 2% my piano
* 110% silly fun

Edited/assembled in Record. For this mix, I tried to keep it real to what would be possible on the app. I intend to one day go back and do a more complex mix.

One day.
