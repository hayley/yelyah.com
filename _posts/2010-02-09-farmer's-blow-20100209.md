"Farmer's Blow" is redneck rap. Oh yeah, I went there.

<pre>
If you're on the run
And your nose has gotta go
Don't grab a tissue
Do the farmer's blow

Just tilt your head
To the side
Then block one nostril
And let it ride

You may think
That it's obscene
But it's quite the opposite
Where I been

Got a snot ball
But no Kleenex in your pocket
Don't you despair
Just do a snot rocket

Seriously
It's like the most awesomest thing ever
And if you don't think so
Well then you can suck it
  
If you're on the run
And your nose has gotta go
Don't grab a tissue
Do the farmer's blow

Just tilt your head
To the side
Then block one nostril
And let it ride

On that last long run
I felt your icy stare
But just get over it
I snotted in your hair

If it makes you feel better
I've also been there
Billy Sue Joe Bob
Snotted on a bear
