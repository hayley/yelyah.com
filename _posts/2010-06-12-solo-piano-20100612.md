Thanks to my mom's new dehumidifier, I can tell you that dehumidifiers are:

* super noisy
* generate a lot of heat

And thanks to Amazon, I can also say:

* all dehumidifiers have horrible reliability

I'm surprised I hadn't come across a mention of the heat that dehumidifiers generate whilst helping her look for one. Of course, maybe that's because lots of people are using them in their basements and aren't exposed to the 5-10+ degree shift they can cause (at least measured near the source, it got that much hotter).

I'll probably recommend that she take it back. After she lets me borrow it first of course.
