So I've been noticing this strange new problem: phantom damper pedal control messages.

Either Record is straight up making data up or the piano is transmitting damper pedal... positions when it shouldn't be.

It doesn't seem to affect my normal takes (which of course, largely consist of the damper pedal being completely stomped on, and this phantom data seems to be slight presses of the damper pedal.

Ghost in the machine again.
