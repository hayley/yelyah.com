My first rock song. Yay.

--
<pre>
Don't tell me you want flowers
Don't tell me what to do
You're special and you know it
So here's what I got you

It's another god damn love song
Another chance for me
To woo you

You're outta my league and you know it
But why are you always having
To show it

You always think that you're the one who's loved the most
But that doesn't I'm just the parasite to your host
It's not about you one hundred percent of the time
Cause this song is mine

It's another bloody love song
One more chance for me
To think things through

Why did I ever love you
Why didn't I ever fully think this thing through

[chorus]
