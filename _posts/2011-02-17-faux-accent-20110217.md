I love accents. And I finally decided to try out this idea and do a bit of silliness with the weather.

Of course this would call for setting up a niche tumblr for just this sort of thing. So I present to you: [faux accent](http://fauxaccent.tumblr.com) - the place to get the US severe weather report read in a fake accent.

Today's fake accent is brought to you by either New Zealand or Australia. I haven't mastered the difference.

Tomorrow I look forward to butchering another accent. Perhaps some Scotch-Irish.
