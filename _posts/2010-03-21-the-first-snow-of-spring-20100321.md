Of all the days I had to get up super early, it happened to fall on the first day of spring. Also known as (fingers crossed) the worst day of spring.

I spent part of the early morning digging my car out from underneath the ice and snow. Later, visibility plummeted as the snowflakes came back in droves and scattered throughout the land. I wondered if there was still a sun out there somewhere.

So screw you mother nature, I dedicate this song to you.
