This improv proves that I don't absolutely require a damper pedal, all the time. No probably more like 99% of the time.

Way way back in the day I seldom ever played with a damper pedal. It could've been that the pedal itself was to blame. It was cheesy and (though I don't remember at this point) may have just been an ON/OFF pedal rather than something more like the real thing (ya know, the pedal on an actual acoustic piano).

So instead of just using the pedal to carry me, I actually played with deliberate legato.

Now I'm just lazy.
