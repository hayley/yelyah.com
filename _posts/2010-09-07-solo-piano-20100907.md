It's the little, silly things in life.

After mentioning yesterday about my desire to make it to level 60 in Uncharted 2, so that I could play as [Doughnut Drake](http://www.flickr.com/photos/naughty_dog/4133749079/in/set-72157622876126468/), I finally caught my first sighting of Doughnut Drake in the wild. I see tons and tons of people playing as the skeleton guy (Marco Polo I think), but this was the first time I had ever seen anyone playing as Doughnut Drake.

And today was my last day with Uncharted 2. It was due at the library. So, um. Hello future productivity!
