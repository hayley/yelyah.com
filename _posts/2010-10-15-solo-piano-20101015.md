Additional panic sets in as I realize that I haven't even looked at what information the different weather API providers... provide.

Can I even get the chance-of-rain information that I need to pull off this project?

Perhaps instead of the laundry weather site predictions being based off of actual forecasts, it can be a magic 8 ball instead.

Should I hang my laundry outside today?

_Outlook not so good_
