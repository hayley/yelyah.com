Today's freakout courtesy of the playstation 3.

Uncharted 2 locked up on me then refused to boot.

I, of course, thought the worst - that my ps3 was toast - but it turns out (or so it seems so far) that only Uncharted 2 was affected.

I tried the suggestions of deleting the game data. But I didn't go so far as trying to delete the saved data.

Another suggestion I read was that the disc might be bad. Of course, it had run fine up to this point, so I didn't think it was possible, but apparently that was the cause.

I guess that's what I get for using a public library copy of Uncharted 2.
