I sometimes wonder if this [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) pursuit is self sabotage.

See, I have programmer's amnesia. If I let enough time lapse from the last time I worked on something, I (feel like I) might as well be starting over from scratch. And whether true or not, it sure puts a big mental hurdle in my way.

And in the time that I've been trying to figure out how to approach learning node.js (since I have no real background in JS and it's *all* foreign to me)... well, in that time, I haven't touched Python at all.

Given enough time, I'll forget it all. Or at least I'll claim I've forgotten it all, because it will feel that way.

So I feel like I need to hurry up and get started on an actual JS related project, ya know, so that if I do forget Python, at least I won't have forgotten how to program in general.

And Uncharted 2 is due at the library, so I must temporarily withhold my quest to get to level 60 so I can play as [Doughnut Drake](http://www.flickr.com/photos/naughty_dog/4133749121/). So surely that will free up brain space to focus on programming. Right?
