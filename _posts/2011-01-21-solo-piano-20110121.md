First world problem: I have access to so many books that I want to read that I often "forget" to read any of them.

Seriously though, I do need some sort of library or todo list. And of course, one of my problems is that I get a large chunk of stuff through my local library and I'm often on the wait-list for books. So it's quite often that, by the time I finally get the book in my hands, I'm either not interested in it anymore, or several of them come available all at the same time and I have no clue which to read. So I end up reading none of them.

Ah, first world problems.
