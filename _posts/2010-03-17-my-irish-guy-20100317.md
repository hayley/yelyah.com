Oh, I had such big plans for this song. Acoustic guitar, tin whistle, maybe go and drag the bagpipes out of storage (cough, or as the case really would be: fire up Logic, so I can use an external plugin).

I went to storm spotters training instead.

So all I really had time for, was to finish writing the lyrics and do a one take vocal.

On the plus side, surely tonight's training will help with my upcoming song "Tornado Warning" (Full disclosure: I started the song *last* Spring, so "upcoming" really means nothing in my world.)
