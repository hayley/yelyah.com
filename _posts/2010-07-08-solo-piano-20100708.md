So I bought a Nook with gift cards. I'm definitely taking the one I got back for an exchange. The buttons on the left side make a kind of cracking noise. And all of the Nooks I've played with have equal sounding buttons on both sides so I'm pretty sure it's a defect.

But now I'm thinking I might just take it back completely. I love e-ink, but I guess I'm not reading as much as I thought I would.

Or maybe it's the fact that I know I'm taking that specific one back, so I haven't made it "mine".

Since I bought it with gift cards, I'd probably get the money back in gift cards. If they'd give me cash, I'd probably return it in a heartbeat.
