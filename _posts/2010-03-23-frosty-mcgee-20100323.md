Silly song. Silly lyrics.

One live take. I recorded the piano and vocals simultaneously, though if you want to get geeky about it, the piano was via MIDI. However, if you listen closely you might be able to hear me hitting the keys in the background on the vocal track.

I'm finding fun and freedom in following the flaws of live performance (ran out of effs).
