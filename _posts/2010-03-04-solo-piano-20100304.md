"solo piano 20100304"

---

Piano may be easier to write on, but some days it's really difficult to *record* on.

I only need one good take. And since this is going in as MIDI, "one good take" just means that it needs to be *mostly* right. And jeebs, today was a day where I couldn't even get that close.
