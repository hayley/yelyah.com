Personal insights learned today: When I program, I seek immediate gratification. Which is why I had to part ways with the [openlayers mapping JavaScript library](http://openlayers.org).

As far as I can tell there are no official tutorials. No spoon feeding. There is lots of example code, but the code isn't commented.

Hence my personal quirk that I learned: if I'm going to have to spend a huge chunk of time learning JS just to understand openlayers, there's no way I'm ever gonna learn it.

If I stay in programmer mode for much longer, I'd like to come back to openlayers someday, but not until I have a black belt in JavaScript apparently.
