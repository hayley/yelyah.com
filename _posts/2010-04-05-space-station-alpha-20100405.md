I never did get the backwards piano crescendo quite how I wanted it. I guess it would be one big argument for working with it as an audio file, rather than an NNXT set to play a sample backwards.

Also, the timing at the end feels screwy. My guess is that the delayed attack of the pad makes it feel like the other part is coming in too early.

I'll fix it one day.
