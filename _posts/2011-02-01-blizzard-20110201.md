Welcome to day #1 of year #2.

Last February 1st marked the beginning of [FAWM](http://fawm.org) and the beginning of my return to songwriting after a break of a few months.

I had basically gone from doing a song in a day in August, to absolutely nothing until FAWM came around.

I wanted to see if I was still capable of doing a song a day. So my intention was to do one song every day in February during FAWM, but I had no idea that I would end up going for a complete year.

I have many hopes for this next year, but it the journey of 365 days begins with a single entry.

Here is day #1.
