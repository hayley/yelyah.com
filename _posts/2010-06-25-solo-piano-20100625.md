May I admit that I'm secretly (not so secret anymore) having schadenfreude over the iPhone 4 antenna problems?

I'm definitely disappointed that such a serious problem made it into a device, and also that Apple is apparently advising people to *not hold their phone that way*, but I'm secretly somewhat happy that there are problems, because I've basically already decided that I'm just gonna keep my current iPhone and let my contract run out.

I don't even dare find out if I'm eligible for an upgrade yet. *I don't want to know*. I just would like to be able to drop AT&T for something better when the time comes. So no upgrades for me.
