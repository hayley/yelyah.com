Confession: I'm looking forward to seeing if the piano lessons in Garageband '11 will motivate me to practice.

If you don't count all of the playing I do when I'm composing, then I haven't actually *practiced* piano in probably well over a year.

And I've already been thinking that I need to start setting up some kind of structure and try to get some semi-serious piano practicing going.

Because I'd really like to "unlock" some new piano playing skills so that I could branch out with my composing. And really that's the problem. I've only ever really been motivated by the *tangential* rewards of practicing.

Which obviously hasn't been enough to get me practice. Yet.
