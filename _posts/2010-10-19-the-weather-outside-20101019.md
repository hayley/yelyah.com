"the weather outside 20101019" ambient improv

I decided that I had to throw something together *soon* for http://theweather.at because it's just not right to always have the sound of a thunderstorm regardless of the actual weather conditions.

So my big plan was to work on that today. And hey, I actually did.

I bought [Aura Flux](http://www.higefive.com/apps/flux/) for the iphone/ipad last night specifically with the intention of using it to create some background music for http://theweather.at. Given how many ipad music apps are $10+, I think this one is a steal at $2. As a comparison, Brian Eno's Bloom, which is the same basic premise but has fewer features, is $4 for *each* version of the iphone and ipad apps (so $2 vs. $8 total).

As luck would have it, I also got my mixlr invite this morning, so I decided to livestream the making of theweather.at ambient music. You can visit http://mixlr.com/yelyah for the unedited version of the live performance. The snipped version is what is attached to this post and it's basically the same thing, only I snipped out the irrelevant intro and ending.

At this point, I've got several mp3s ready to go announcing the current weather conditions (sort of anyway and you'll know what I mean if you hear one of them) and then layered with the song that's here.

All I have to do is figure out where to host them and then add them to the site via the admin interface.

Well, and then there's the hour-long caching I set up. So really, I figure they'll be up on the site in 2 hours or so.

Alternately, check them out now on the [yelyah posterous](http://p.yelyah.com/new-sounds-for-theweatherat).
