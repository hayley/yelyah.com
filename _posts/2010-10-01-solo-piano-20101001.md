Random tangential trivia. If you chop off the 2 in today's date, it would be a binary number and would be 41 in decimal (Assuming you follow the %Y%m%d date format).

Also, if you missed your new year's resolutions from January, set some new ones because today is the new year for US govt offices.

Happy new year!
