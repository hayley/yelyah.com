"yelyah - "solo piano 20100921" piano improv

The 2-note-chords that kick off this song were inspired by Melissa Etheridge's "We are the Ones". It was something I started playing towards the end of her song, and whether or not I had the proper harmony becomes somewhat moot since it was the inspiration I needed to kick off my own thing.
