Song #3 for FAWM.

I might as well officially say that I'm attempting to go 28 for 28.

Maybe nuts, but I seem to feel the need to prove to myself that I'm the same person who could write a song a day (24 in 24) back in August.

This song has lyrics, but you wouldn't know that, because this version is solo piano.

It took something like 180 minutes to write. Which I had to break into 2 songwriting sessions due to burnout.

I'd like to come back to it and actually make a vocal version. But that will probably happen post-FAWM.
