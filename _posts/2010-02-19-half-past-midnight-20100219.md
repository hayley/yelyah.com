"half past midnight"

I get to say that it borders on hip-hop because there's a hip hop drum loop and a hip hop drum kit on it. I have no idea what to call it other than "electronic". With a piano.

This is my second song using Record.

I was going through a book on Reason which featured a tutorial on how to do a backwardsy reverb effect in the RV7000 using the loop that you hear at the beginning of the song. I started playing against it on the piano and decided to see where I could take it.
