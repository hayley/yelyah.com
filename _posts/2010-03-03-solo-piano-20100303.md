"solo piano 20100303"

---

I haven't written something that was pure piano since the 18th.

I went into today's session with the intention of writing something solely on piano, since I've had a couple of really draining sessions lately (mostly due to the fact that I managed to time my writing sessions with energy crashes).

For me, going back to the fundamentals is a great way to ease burnout.

There's no question as to what patches to use (okay, granted, you can spend a decent amount of time tweaking the piano settings). There's no click, no sequencer involved at all. You just play.

And of course, this is why I'd love to become a better pianist. There's only so much my left hand can play against my right hand, before I have to get a sequencer involved.
