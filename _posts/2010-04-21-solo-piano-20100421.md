The problem with committing to doing an improv is when you really f*&# it up, you have to either completely stop the take (I admit, I did that the first time when I screwed up in the first 30 seconds) or just try to recover, by making it sound intentional.

And you'll probably know what I'm talking about when you hear it.

So yeah. *Totally intentional.*
