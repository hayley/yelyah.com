I beat Split/Second today. On the final race, I kept coming in last (I needed to place 3rd to beat the game). Then through sheer luck (read: awesome driving), I ended up near the front on the pack in the 3rd lap.

As we all (CPUs + me) rounded the corner to the finish line, I somehow broke away and made it into 1st place.

From 8th to 1st is pretty surreal.

And yes, I need a life.
