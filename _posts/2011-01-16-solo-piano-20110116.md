Apparently, I'm operating under the principle that, the more testing frameworks you use, surely the more better [sic] you're code will be.

At least, I finally do have some tests written, but I'm still often uncertain where to draw the line between which frameworks do what.

And next, it's time for me to write some proper documentation too, so that I can really remind myself what that function does. You know, the function I wrote *last week*.

That's how my memory goes..
