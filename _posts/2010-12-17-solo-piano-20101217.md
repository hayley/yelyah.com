[drum hayley drum](http://drummer.heroku.com/) is what I've nicknamed my new project. It displays my drumming stats from Rock Band.

The reason I was creating the site in the first place was to do the following: I tell the site what difficulty level and what speed and it tells me what songs I *haven't* practiced at that level yet. And oddly enough, this was basically the *last* thing I figured out how to do. At one point, I had even made peace with the fact that it probably wasn't going to get done in this 48 hour window.

And I should also note, that the feature listed above, is not actually linked to on any of the public pages since it's basically only relevant to me.

So a sampling of some of the random things that it also displays:

* [songs played on expert level](http://drummer.heroku.com/difficulty/expert)
* [songs I've played left-handed](http://drummer.heroku.com/lefty)
* [my epic fail list](http://drummer.heroku.com/fail) (songs I bombed out on)
* [my epic win list](http://drummer.heroku.com/epicwin) (songs I've scored 100% on - currently there is ONE entry there.. surely, there will be more... soon)

I spent most of my time trying to figure out all of the database related stuff I needed to do. And I never did build a proper admin interface. Instead, I have a google spreadsheet and a script. I update the spreadsheet and then I manually run the script to update the database. It's a hack, but I like it.

Drum on!
