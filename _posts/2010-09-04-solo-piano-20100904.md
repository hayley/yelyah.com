Don't you hate it when you get an awesome idea, but you don't have the technical chops to pull it off?

Specifically, I've been wanting to write some custom ear training software for awhile now. The problem? It's always been way out of the league of my current ability.

See, I'm learning that what *really* drives me to learn programming is when I can immediately jump into what it is that I actually want to write. Otherwise, motivation wanes too quickly to get anything of consequence accomplished.

Well, today I finally latched onto an ear training related idea that's still out of my league, but may well be close enough that I can bust through the grey area with some of that blessed blind confidence.

If I'm gonna pull it off, I have to figure out some early, quick wins to get.

Otherwise, I'm doomed.
