Today I learned that I should probably remove the profanity from my source code. Because there are occasions when it will show up where you don't intend it.

Specifically it was on a text substitution that failed, leaving my "h2end" intact (it's supposed to get translated to &lt;/h2&gt;.

Now that one's not so bad. It's the NEW&lt;profanity&gt;LINE I'm worried about.
