Geekiest thing I did today: used time where my internet access was down to finally write the DSL modem scraper script I've been meaning to write for ages.

So now, with one call to a ruby script I get my Signal to Noise margin and my CRC errors.

To be clear, this one command saves me from opening a browser, going to the modem's internal page, then viewing its stats. So not a big time saver there.

Which kinda shows how automate-happy I can get.
