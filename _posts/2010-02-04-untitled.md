Song #4 for FAWM. More solo piano.

One of the things I struggle with, with all of these pure piano pieces is how much to edit/fix them.

Way way back in the day, I quantized everything precisely and made all of the velocities the same. To this day, I have no idea why I was messing with note volumes like that. It all made for some Very. Robotic. Playing.

These days I think I almost border on leaving the performance too human. I leave complete mistakes in sometimes (if they sort of work). I leave sloppy timings in. I've stopped quantizing by default. Now, I just seem to be fixing the horrible stuff.

I always assume I'll come back to it and really learn how to play the piece mistake free and do it in one-take and leave it completely alone.

Yeah, someday.
