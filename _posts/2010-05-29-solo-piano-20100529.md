Today, I bought a bunch of different mint plants and a stevia plant.

I had never had fresh stevia before. Like the dried form, it's very sweet and you think it's lovely.

THEN THE AFTERTASTE.

That is why my professional recommendation is to only use stevia in drinks. Somehow the aftertaste is negated if it's used in a liquid.

Perhaps it's a time based thing: the longer your taste buds are in contact with the stevia, the greater the chance that you will get hit with the aftertaste.

That is probably why you shouldn't gargle with stevia.
