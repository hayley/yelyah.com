Pardon me. I'm a wee bit brain dead.

So I'm gonna switch to bulleted-list mode to get this out.

* I survived Rails Rumble but I'm quite paranoid that I'm gonna get booted at some point because of some deployment drama that happened at the last minute. I'm *hoping* it won't count against me but I'm prepared (or so I think) for the worst.

* This is my entry: http://173.255.227.49/

* I haven't figured out a name yet. I own theweather.at and maybe this is finally the site worthy of that name, but I don't know. Part of the problem is that I haven't figured out where it's going to be hosted. And why these two things are tied together is something that only *my* half-dead brain can comprehend.

* **The purpose of the site is to display your current weather conditions and display a relevant picture and have some relevant audio.**

* Right now there's only 1 sound file. So if it's snowing, you'll hear a thunderstorm. If it's sunny, *thunderstorm for you* and so on.

* If you're interested in submitting your own audio interpretation of what things like "partly cloudy" sound like, definitely get in touch.

* I haven't quite decided at this point what I'd *like* to see audio wise. My original thought was for the music/sound to be something that you could have in the background. If you've ever been to http://www.rainymood.com/ then picture that but with audio relevant to your current conditions. That was the original idea, though I have no idea if I'll stick to it. If you have your own opinion on what sort of things would be appropriate for the site, speak up.

* If you are interested in submitting something, here is what (I hope) is a complete list of possible weather conditions.
