Oh yeah. The silly a cappellas are back. 

<pre>
Ideas they are like water
Just floating all along
But you really can't hold on

Ideas they are elusive
You can chase 'em everyday
In the end they get away

So get that old idea
And dust it off
It don't matter if it's good or not
It's the fact that you
Showed up
So sit your butt back down and get back to work

Ideas they are like sandwiches
If the meat's a little rotten
Cover in mayo till it's forgotten

Ideas they are like bacon
MMMM bacon
</pre>
