Apparently my 2 cats are plotting against me.

One of them ruined my bathmat and got a lovely stain on the carpet.

The other, who prior to the 5th had never jumped on my laptop before, jumped on my laptop *again* tonight. This time there wasn't a question as to whether the cat broke my flow, because this time, the cat actually managed to stop the recording.

I tried to capture the magic of the original improv by starting again, as opposed to the 5th where I decided to leave it as is. But it was no use.

Thanks, you bastages.
