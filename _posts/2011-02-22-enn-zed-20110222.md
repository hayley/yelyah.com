My thoughts are with the people of Christchurch who were hit by a massive earthquake on Tuesday, NZDT.

It's been quite surreal watching all of the live coverage.

Though this earthquake was of a lesser magnitude than September's, this one was much closer to Christchurch and was at a much shallower depth (5km vs 10km).

On the map below, the 2010 earthquake is marker A and Tuesday's earthquake is marker B.

* [2010 Canterbury earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_New_Zealand_earthquake)
* [2011 Canterbury earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canterbury_earthquake)

Things I've learned.

* first, I had never even thought about earthquake *depth* before, so that was a new concept
* I had incorrectly thought that casualty == fatality. I assumed that the NZ usage of "casualty" was regional/of British origin, but it turns out that casualty has a universal meaning, and it's both injuries and fatalities.
* [soil liquefaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction) is responsible for all of the water on the ground and roadways. In a sense, the ground is flooding. From below.
* [Hilary Barry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Barry) was the anchor that I saw a lot of on the first day. I think she did an amazing job considering all of the chaos of the day.
* Christchurch has had many aftershocks in the time after the September earthquake, including a [4.9 on Boxing Day](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/8225598/Boxing-Day-shoppers-hit-by-New-Zealand-earthquake.html). The Tuesday earthquake is even considered an aftershock of the initial September quake.

Though I'm sure it will be difficult for things to ever be the same, I wish the people of Christchurch a speedy recovery.
