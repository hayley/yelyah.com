Confession: Last time I did the song-a-day project, I came up with an idea from scratch every day. I intended to do the same thing this time around.

This piece breaks that rule in two ways.

1. I wrote the opening part over the weekend.
2. That part itself was a derivation of something I wrote years and years ago. Which is the major-key section you hear towards the end. (The very end was improv'd as I recorded it, which I think you can tell. One of these days I'll finalize the ending.)
