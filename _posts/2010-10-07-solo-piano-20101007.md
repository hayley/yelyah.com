Some days I come up with an intro I really like. Then manage to screw up the part right after that and decide to just restart.

Inevitably, these days seem to also line up with my INability to play the intro properly the second time, third time, and so on. Ya know, it's the part that I played just fine the first go round and then, for the life of me, I just can't nail it on those additional takes.

Wait, did I say *some* days?

Most days.
