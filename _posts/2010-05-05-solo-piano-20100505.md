The decision to start with the chords was loosely inspired by the music I was listening to before I started the improv. Specifically, the solo of Tori Amos' "Cornflake Girl" was my jumping off point.

I also find it amusing that I apparently never let go of the damper pedal. At all. Either it was a recording glitch, or my foot was depressed the whole time.

And as a random aside, I get in trouble every time I play an acoustic piano, because I treat the damper pedal as though it's the kick pedal on a drum set. SLAM. Which makes a fun noise as a whole bunch of notes ring out at once.

See, sometimes realism in a plugin is a bad thing.
