"my jetpack" a floaty, atmospheric type piece.

Notes:  
I'm not thrilled with the strings (the part that only shows up once in the piece). I need to blend them more. They're too abrupt.

I think the "percussion" may get too loud towards the end.

I learned important stuff today, such as how to control more than one device (via advanced midi) and how to send to a MIDI channel other than #1, on my Roland.

And I learned how to make glitchy beats glitchier with lots and lots of effects. Whether it fits in the piece.... well, that's a question for another day.
