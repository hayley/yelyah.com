As an example of how short my memory is, 5 minutes after tonight's improv, I was listening back to it. It took me a full 3 minutes to realize I was listening to *last* night's improv.

I guess this explains why my improvs are seldom ever ABAB, I simply can't remember A after playing B.

Scary or skill?
