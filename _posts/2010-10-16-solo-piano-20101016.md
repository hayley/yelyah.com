I had something pretty horrible happen last night.

The Rails Rumble started last night and I was absolutely paralyzed.

I had no idea how to first approach the project and my idea was not compelling enough to get me to break through the mental barrier.

It's all "resolved" at this point. Or at least I hope so.

I simply decided to pursue a different idea. One that hadn't even been on my idea list, but reading through some of the optional Rumble challenges made me remember it.

I feel it's way more ambitious than my original idea, but the huge thing is that I can actually see a path. I knew where to start and have already made some progress last night.

Never mind the fact that it took me 3-4 hours to solve something that should've been solved in 15 minutes.

*It's progress.*
