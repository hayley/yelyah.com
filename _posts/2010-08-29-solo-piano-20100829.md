It's funny to me how one "wrong" note (playing an A natural instead of an A flat) ended up  changing the direction of the improv.

This would seem to imply that I have some sort of direction when I start. Most of the time, I don't.

More like micro-directions from a GPS that's always keeping on my toes.

Or something.
