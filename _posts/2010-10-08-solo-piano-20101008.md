Amusing to me is the fact that most of my "prepared" piano pieces (as opposed to improvs) are short. Like 1-2 minutes.

My improvs seem to be hovering around the 4-6 minute range.

I can chalk some of that up to my ear for repetition. And my ears are in overdrive when I'm hearing one section for the thirtieth time in one session.

And I can chalk most of the rest up to days like these, where I have an ending in my head and I can't find the actual chord so I have to keep circling it and trying to find it because I don't want to end the song mid-phrase.
