I got a kick out of my Galcon stalker last night, who left the session named as 'NAMEgo2chat' and came back as 'NAMEiloveu'.

To me, it's bizarre. Galcon has no built-in text chat nor voice chat, so they know nothing about me other than the fact that I have a girl username. So few qualifications to become a stalkee.

I'm amused by the whole thing but I started playing under a different alias anyhow.

I'd liked to be admired for something other than my crazy mad Galcon skillz.
