I think it's time to start rushing through the Ruby book I'm working on so that I can move on to learning Rails because I'm getting antsy and want to start *building* something.

When I originally started messing with Django, I didn't feel the need to start with a general Python book first, because Python's syntax has always felt pretty straight forward to me.

But with Ruby on Rails, there's enough strange looking things (like => and the code blocks for things like the .each method) that I thought it would be better to start off with the fundamentals of the language itself. Especially given that I have a timeline (Rails Rumble), so I can't quite learn at a casual pace.

I need that knowledge, like yesterday.
