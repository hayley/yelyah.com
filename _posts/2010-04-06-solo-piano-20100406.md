Today, I did a live improv basically because I had to.

For some history, back when I was doing song-a-day in August, I was generally doing my daily song as the last thing of the day. It worked well. It gave me a nearly a full day to come up with something to write about and became a neat end-cap to my day.

This time around I've been trying to write much earlier in the day. A big reason for that is that I want to clear up mental space so that I can also work on *revising* something else later on in the day.

Well, despite my early streak, today I just didn't get around to it. Which would've been uneventful.

Had we not lost power.

And as I write this, lightning is sporadically, um.. lighting up the sky. Not much to write home about at the moment, but given that we lost power *after* our earlier storm had already rolled through, I'm not taking any chances.

And given that I live in an area that was once known for its 6+ hour power outages, it does make me wonder about nerdy things such as, what is my "disaster recovery plan". The plan that tells me what to do if I haven't finished my daily song, but my power is out.

It's times like these where it might be nice to have some, ya know, *acoustic* instruments lying around.
