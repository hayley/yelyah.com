This is a patch I frequently revisit for improvs. And by frequently.. okay, so maybe this is the 3rd or 4th time, as compared to the (literally?) hundreds of uses of a specific piano patch that I use for improvs.

I kept hitting the B natural earlier than intended. And sometimes I swear my fingers are leading to *remake* mistakes so that it can say on some level "I meant to do that!"

Well, I didn't.
