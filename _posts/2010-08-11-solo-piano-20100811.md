I implemented severe weather warnings on my weather site, just in time to actually be affected by one.

Alright, so "just in time" was like 12 hours before, but still.

Also, I think this may well be the first severe weather season I can remember where we haven't had the sirens go off ONCE (other than for monthly tests of course).

Which I guess I'm fine with. I want to chase the storms, not have them chase me.
