I'm not sure it's even noticeable now, but I cranked the reverb decay a bit. I had cranked it to the maximum setting for the piano patch and it made for some interesting long reverb tails when I was messing around. But ultimately, they became too massive and overpowered the rest of what was going on. Good for an effect, bad for trying to convey something specific.
