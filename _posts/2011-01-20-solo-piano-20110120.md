In the vein of the joke "Those of you who think you know everything annoy those of us who do"...

It's been a frustrating 24 hours. 3 separate acts of random stupidity by others that directly affected me.

The pièce de résistance was definitely the family member that dropped and subsequently broke their iphone.

Yeah, and guess who's the idiot that paid for it and will have to deal with the fallout over the breakage.

Me.
