I continue to struggle with hand independence. I tried to teach myself the left hand pattern that starts the song, so that I could riff against it. But no. Just couldn't get it. So I decided to switch to block chords for the actual melody improvisation.

So then you have this. A live take with an improvised melody. The pauses weren't for dramatic effect. They were my head locking up, forgetting where I was supposed to go next.

Fun.
