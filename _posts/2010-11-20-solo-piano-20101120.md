It's always fun when I try to "memorize" a new left hand pattern at the same time that I'm improv'ing against it.

Especially since these new patterns often have unfamiliar harmonic territory.

I don't have a whole lot of harmonies consciously memorized, so I'm generally relying on the hope that my hands know what my brain is talking about. Which led to things like originally hitting a B natural instead of a B flat since I wasn't consciously aware that I was playing in the key of F major.

So yes, put it on the todo list: *stay conscious*. Yeah.
