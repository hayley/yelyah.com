I hate November. And a large part of that is because of daylight savings time.

To me, November is the most depressing month because it has the shortest days. Technically, it isn't actually the shortest, but I judge things on when the sun sets.

And daylight savings time makes it even worse. Suddenly the sun is setting an hour earlier making the short days even more noticeable.

Bummer.
