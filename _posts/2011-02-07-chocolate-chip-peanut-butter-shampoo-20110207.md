In an effort to declutter my bathroom and (gasp) use things I've already paid for, I've been going through all of my partially used shampoos and using them completely so that I can toss the bottles.

Yesterday's shampoo was Giovanni's Tea Tree Triple Threat. I couldn't put my finger on it at the time, but the shampoo's smell greatly reminded me of something else.

Today, I figured it out.

*Matt's Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies*

Now I'm confused as to whether I should be asking why a shampoo smells like food or why a food smells like shampoo. Because the scent isn't compelling me in either direction.

I can say that this shampoo is not good in the winter. As I've been unfortunately learning, anything with peppermint oil absolutely freezes my scalp. And some day I hope to actually find out why peppermint can cause such a physical reaction when it's not actually lowering the temperature of the environment.

Lucky for me though, the shampoo bottle is now empty. Mission accomplished.
