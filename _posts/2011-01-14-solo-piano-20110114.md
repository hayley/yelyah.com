I've known vi/vim for 1.5+ decades. It's my go-to editor anytime I'm making a quick edit from the command line.

Yet I've never attempted to make it my *only* editor.

Probably because, by default, it's ugly and you have to deliberately seek out instructions on how to beautify it.

I am now armed with some of the "beautification" options, so I've decided that I'm gonna make a real attempt at learning vi/vim **in depth** this time. Specifically, I'm going to be using [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) so that I can keep my editing fonts and my shell fonts as separate options (I prefer a smaller font for the command line than I do for editing).

I'm definitely keeping up with the up and coming [Kod](http://kodapp.com/) editor though. Which is actually one of the reasons I'm attempting this *now*: Kod is still immature enough that I need to do this now before Kod becomes a compelling option.

And learning Emacs *at all* is still on my list. Somewhere.
