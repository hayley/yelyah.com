Some days I precisely quantize things, and make sure to tame any overly loud/soft notes.

And then some days are like these, where I turn off the click and decide to do things in one take, without fixing a thing. That seldom ever means it's perfect or even close to perfection. I guess I just find it interesting to do a "live" performance every so often.

Or we could just blame it on laziness.
