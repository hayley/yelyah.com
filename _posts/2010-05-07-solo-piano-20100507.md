Today, I believe marks the first day where I haven't had to move the song-end-marker.

For background, Record sets the default end marker at measure 100. At the default tempo of 120, this means 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

Since I do almost all of my improvs without a click track, I just leave the default tempo at 120.

And when you've done enough writing in a row, really silly things tend to make you go wow. So today I was wowed by the fact that the 3:20 mark was the logical place to leave the end marker.

Need hobby!
