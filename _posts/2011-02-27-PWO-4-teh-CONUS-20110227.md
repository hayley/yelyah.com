title: PWO 4 teh CONUS 20110227
---

I has me some acronym overload. PWO = public weather outlook. CONUS = continental United States. teh = the. Like, obviously.

Stare at the Storm Prediction Center forecasts enough and you'll pick up lots of acronyms. ARKLATEX is probably my fave (Arkansas/Louisiana/Texas region as per their acronym page).

If you venture over to [wickedwx](http://wickedwx.com/), you'll now see a top banner that gives a synopsis of the current public severe weather outlook. Which is:

> SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED OVER PARTS OF ARKANSAS NORTHEASTWARD TO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT

I've already had problems where the regular expression that I used to grab that 2 line overview has been *greedy* and it ended up giving me half a page instead of a couple sentences.

It's supposed to be fixed now, but given how quickly I rolled this new feature out, I haven't put anything in my template to guard against overly long summaries.

So I look forward to the day that [wickedwx.com](http://wickedwx.com) is half covered by a severe weather outlook.

I is good!
