If you've ever seen my last.fm profile, you might have a good guess as to who I was riffing off of with the beginning.

Sometimes I warm up before improv'ing; sometimes I record it.

I started out playing the original version of what I ended up riffing off of. I hit some notes that were out of the original song's key and liked the new direction. So I decided to start anew and record it.
