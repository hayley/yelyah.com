I dig the chorus idea on this one, but sadly never found the same footing for any of the other sections.

I can blame my fingernails.

I was warming up beforehand and playing amazingly sloppily. Some days I think it's that my brain just isn't working, but I really do thing too-long-fingernails are definitely a detriment, because you tend to kinda slip on the keys.

That's it. No more excuses. Time for a trim.
