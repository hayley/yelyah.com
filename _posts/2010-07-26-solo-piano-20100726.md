It is clear to me that I have somehow escaped learning anything directly about OOP despite having touched all sorts of parts of it via python and even more so via django (I've written classes that inherit stuff - I'm writing OOP code and not even knowing it).

Now I'm having to read... books... just so I can have a grasp of what it is I want. Because you can't google "make my code less tedious" and get back a meaningful result.
