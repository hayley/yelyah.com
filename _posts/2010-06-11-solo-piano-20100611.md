My crowning achievement yesterday was whilst playing Uncharted 2, I came across an area that I just could not beat.

There were too many grenades and heavily armored shotgun guys.

So my "this gives me way too much of a thrill" moment, was when I learned that I could just sneak past the guys guarding the area, and then the grenade and shotgun guys would never spawn and I could go on my merry way.

My big achievement *today* was running around like an idiot for a half an hour, trying to get Lazarevic to kill himself.

Which would sound way worse out of context.
