There were some "less grounded" moments in this piece and you probably don't even have to be listening closely to catch them.

Still I persevered because it takes some real strength to not just crumble when your brain has completely stopped and you've landed on the wrong chord and possibly even worse is that you forgot what chord you came from.

Just gotta keep playing while you try to refresh your memory. Not always that easy.
