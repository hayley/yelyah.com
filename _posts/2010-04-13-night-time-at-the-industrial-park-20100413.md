I'd be lying if I said I came up with all of the sounds for this one. Really, like 80% of the credit goes to the patch I used and 20% goes to my playing and post-tweaking.

I'd like to do more with this, but one of the problems I ran into was the fact that I held a low note for the entirety of the song. So I'll have to go back and split that thing off into its own track so that I can start the thing from any point in the song rather than having to start it from the beginning.

And I'll probably also have to hack the patch up into its component sounds for full tweakability.

So yeah, probably never happen, eh?
