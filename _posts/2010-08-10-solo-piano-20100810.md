I was playing to beat a thunderstorm that's rolling my way.

So one would think that I would've instinctively played faster, but nooooo.

It felt different to be so slow. It wasn't a conscious decision. Just started playing that way.

It's like double, no TRIPLE-spacing your paper so that it's enough pages to fit the criteria.

Har har.
