I have task management *app* ADD. What this means is that I've paid for at least 4 separate todo list iphone apps, yet I love none of them for very long.

I'm sure it's due in part to my tech ADD in general, but I think it's because I also start from scratch every time I make a switch.

So maybe it's that I get *too* good and entering in todo items and then I'm overwhelmed and thus feel the need to blow the whole list away.

Yeah, that's surely it.
