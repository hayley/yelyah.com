*A watched pot never boils and a scraped web page never updates.*

I swear every time I want to work on my severe weather warnings web scraper, that's when there are no warnings to scrape.

Granted, it does seem to be that I find some time to work on it in the early morning. AKA the time when warnings are least likely.

But I swear, I wrote the new scraper first thing in the morning. And then for a good many hours there was nothing to scrape.

And literally about 5 minutes after I was away from the computer, *that* was when a warning was finally issued.

*Das ist Leben!*
