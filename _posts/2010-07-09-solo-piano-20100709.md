What's fun are the nights where I just really nail it on the first go. I come up with some motif that I really like.

And then I completely f*ck it up.

This was literally my *eighth* try and I'm pretty sure the motif was better on the very first try.

But I kept having this complete halting mistakes where I'd just have to completely stop.

It must be one of those nights. Or maybe I need to get a proper chair instead of using a balance ball at the piano.
