Sign #37 it's time to drop the home phone service:

* you realize right away that internet access is down, yet it takes you several hours to realize that phone service is toast too

I can blame it on the fact that DSL sync was working, yet ATM was failing, so I guess I was just assuming that it was a DSL only problem.

Where's my Google fiber?
