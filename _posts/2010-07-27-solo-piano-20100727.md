ace of base - ( (100% of original vocalists) || (50% of group members) ) != ace of base

IMHO, if the Berggren sisters drop out, then it's not really Ace of Base anymore and they should change the group name.

I'm still interested in what's in store, but they should've brought in some Corr sisters instead.
