"darkness falls" - another lullaby type piece

---
It seems that any time I feel confident about being able to continue doing a song a day, I jinx my next day.

Like last night, I made it known that I was probably going to continue with song a day in March, whilst starting to revise and polish on the side. And I'd just keep pushing until the day I burned myself out completely.

Today, I felt like it might already be that day.

But I think that I keep learning that there are always ups and downs. And that one can be quite resilient to burnout. Some days suck. Some days rock. Some days are in between. And it seems to be some law that rockin' days are always proceeded by the bad ones.
