[yelyah.com](http://yelyah.com/) is progressing nicely.

Basically, I think I've done everything I wanted for v1 (v5) already. Now is the part that I get stuck on, which is handling the backlog of content.

But unlike the [feed me](http://feedme.heroku.com) project that involves *uploading* a huge backlog of photos, this one will be much less time consuming since all of the data that I want is already uploaded somewhere (tumblr). Now I just have to figure out how to scrape it and turn it into the proper format for jekyll.

Time to bust out the mad coding skillz!
