title: my 2010 resolutions
---
First, most people write their new year's resolutions around new year's of all things. I did too. I just wasn't writing music at the time, so my list was centered on things like wanting a flat stomach (hey, it could happen).
 
Second, since I procrastinate on things like mad, here's the list I wrote like a month ago.
 
I've actually started working on some of the things on my list. In "another god damn love song", I got to play rhythm guitar on a track, and I ventured into a genre I had never tried before.
 
So maybe I'll actually have a list of full of accomplishments this year rather than "meh, I'll just add that to the 2011 list".
 
## piano
 
* become Gabriela Montero (okay, so that's probably gonna take more than 1 year)
* learn more left hand patterns
* study piano embellishments
 
## drums
 
* get to expert level for say 75% of the Rock Band songs
* learn more, basic rhythms
* figure out how to play faster with my right arm (relax!!!)
* figure out how to play the bass drum faster
* learn some paradiddles
* learn more patterns in relation to genres
 
## guitar
 
* learn enough chords to do rhythm guitar in a few songs
 
## voice
 
* get my deep breathing back (and consequently my vocal breath support)
* work with my upper range
* strengthen my upper range so that the transitions from head to chest voice aren't so dramatic
 
## songwriting
 
* become a genre chameleon - the one who can go from genre to genre and make it convincing, the one who can listen to a style and extrapolate what it is that makes that genre sound like that
* take more songs from melody and harmonic progression to fully arranged song
* write more, proper intros rather than just diving right into the song
* learn how to score to video - the writing side of coming up with something that supplements a visual
 
## audio
 
* know where to go (whether sample or synth) when I want a certain sound
* learn how to create a bunch of audio "special effects" (e.g., reverse reverb for spooky vocals)
* learn Record and Reason inside and out
