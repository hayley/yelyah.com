yelyah - "solo piano 20101129" piano improv
 
I think I've settled on the idea for my next ruby rumble. Which is a site to keep track of the ruby rumbles themselves. It's all very meta or something.
 
I figure it's better to implement this site now since I'll be able to use it to track all future rumbles.
 
And hopefully it can serve as proof that my programming skill is actually progressing.
 
Hopefully.
